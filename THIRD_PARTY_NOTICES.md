# Third-party notices

## OptiScaler DLSS-NR (optional download)

OptiScaler DLSS-NR is an independently licensed project, not part of this
application's MIT-licensed implementation:
https://github.com/Dagherbou/OptiScaler_DLSSNR

The optional backend downloads the official v0.1.1.5-dlssnr archive directly
from its release page, with a pinned SHA-256 checksum. No upstream executable,
DLL or source is bundled with Swapper, and its setup/removal scripts are not
executed. Upstream binaries remain unmodified; configuration and tracked
deployment are performed by this application.

The upstream GNU GPL version 3 licence (commit 393e070) is downloaded and
checksum-verified separately because it is not included in the release ZIP.
The licence, RenoDX attribution, and supplied DirectX/FidelityFX/XeSS notices
are retained in the cache and copied into `OptiScaler/licenses` in the game.
Corresponding upstream source: https://github.com/Dagherbou/OptiScaler_DLSSNR/tree/393e070

NVIDIA's Neural Rendering runtime is not supplied by this OptiScaler release.
This integration uses the existing Swapper payload's `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`; it
does not relicense that file or imply NVIDIA support for the integration.

## DLSS5-Feeder

The bundled client add-ons, 64-bit helper, shader and diagnostic verifier are
from the official DLSS5-Feeder v0.12.0 release:
https://github.com/jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder/releases/tag/v0.12.0

The project's MIT licence is included in payload/feeder/licenses/DLSS5-Feeder-LICENSE.txt.
Release archive and component checksums are pinned in src/core/feeder-release.js.

## dgVoodoo2

dgVoodoo2 is a separately licensed runtime dependency for DX8/DX9 translation:
https://github.com/dege-diosg/dgVoodoo2
https://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/ReadmeGeneral/

Its binaries are not bundled with this application. When a DX8/DX9 installation
is requested, the application downloads the complete official v2.87.4 archive,
verifies its pinned SHA-256 checksum and retains the original documentation
and licence in its component cache. dgVoodoo2 remains under its author's
licence, not this application's MIT licence.

## DLSS5-Autopilot

The emulator profile table and parts of the Vulkan/Feeder installation model
were adapted from DLSS5-Autopilot:
https://github.com/Kizzuwatnaa/DLSS5-Autopilot

DLSS5-Autopilot downloads third-party components at runtime. Those components
remain under their own licences.


## VR fork additions

Modified feeder: jlrouzies-fr/DLSS5-Feeder v1.16.0-beta.4, MIT notice retained in payload/feeder/licenses. The transformation script and helper source are in payload/vr-foveated. DFC/RenoDX notices remain beside their components.

ReShade queue-layout headers are unmodified extracts of crosire/reshade commit 18deaa52de0c425a78b329e9cb3c497281cd00ec (BSD-3-Clause); see payload/vr-foveated/native/reshade-internals/LICENSE.md. Modified ReShade V19 is a binary patch; modified source is not supplied.

Detours: Microsoft/Detours commit e4bfd6b03e50de46b47abfbd1e46b384f0c5f833, third_party/Detours/LICENSE.md. OpenXR headers retain Khronos copyright and SPDX notices.

NVIDIA material in the portable application remains under the NVIDIA RTX SDK licence and per-component notices in resources/payload/streamline; it is not covered by MIT or stored in Git history.
